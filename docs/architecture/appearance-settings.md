# Appearance settings

October 9, 2026: the owner asked for a Settings page with a theme customizer and built-in themes, mostly dark with some light ones. This implements the "configurable themes" capability approved on September 30 alongside the Graphite default.

## Scope

- Settings › Appearance offers ten built-in themes: seven dark (Graphite default, Carbon, Midnight, Forest, Petrol, Espresso, Aubergine, taken from the prototype design studies) and three light (Paper, Daylight, Sand).
- The customizer overrides sixteen colours (surfaces, text, actions, signals, chart candles) and the corner radius of the selected theme. Overrides are kept per theme and can be reset.
- A theme only changes colours and radius. It never moves sections; the approved layout is shared by all themes.
- Every built-in theme passes WCAG AA (4.5:1) for text, secondary text, positive, negative and warning on all surfaces, and for the primary button (3:1 for the focus ring). The customizer reports failing pairs but does not block them. A test enforces this for the built-ins.

## Theme builder

The owner then asked for a builder that randomizes colour combinations and saves them under a custom name.

- *Randomize* rolls a dark, light or either-scheme palette: one tinted neutral hue for surfaces and text, one accent hue (same, analogous, complementary or split) for actions and focus, and conventional green/red/amber signals. Inks are lightened (dark) or darkened (light) until every readability check passes, so every roll is readable; a test checks 1,000 rolls.
- The roll becomes the *Random draft* theme and applies immediately. It can be fine-tuned in the customizer like any theme; a new roll replaces it.
- *Save theme* stores whatever is on screen (a draft, or a customized built-in or saved theme) under a name in *My themes*. Names are unique (case-insensitive), at most 40 characters; up to 24 saved themes. Saved themes can be deleted after a confirmation step; deleting the selected one returns to Graphite.
- Saved themes and the draft live in the same `vessel.appearance` entry. Malformed, duplicate or unknown entries are dropped when it is read.

## Implementation

- `frontend/src/features/settings/generator.ts` rolls palettes and suggests names.
- `frontend/src/features/settings/themes.ts` defines the catalogue and contrast checks; `appearance.ts` resolves the selection into CSS custom properties on `<html>` and stores it in `localStorage` under `vessel.appearance`. It is a browser preference, not workspace data, holds nothing sensitive and survives disconnecting. Server-side preference storage is not implemented.
- `initAppearance()` runs before the first render to avoid a flash of Graphite.
- Component styles read only tokens (`--background`, `--card`, `--sidebar`, `--positive`, `--chart-candle-*`, …); hard-coded shell colours were replaced by tokens or `color-mix` of tokens. `styles.css` keeps the Graphite values as the fallback.
- An open chart re-reads the tokens when the theme changes. Level tags choose dark or white text by the tag colour's luminance (`components/chart/ink.ts`).
- Light themes use hollow up candles and solid down candles, keeping red and green free for stops and targets.

## Known limits

- Entry colours, drawing palette and image markup colours are fixed pastel or saturated values chosen for dark backgrounds; pale entries are faint on light themes.
- No "follow system light/dark" option yet, no import/export of custom themes and no renaming (save under a new name, then delete the old one).
