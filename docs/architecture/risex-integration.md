# RISEx integration: research, fit and tasks

Research checked October 5, 2026 against the official [RISEx API reference](https://developer.rise.trade/llms.txt) and live unauthenticated reads of the mainnet REST API (`https://api.rise.trade`). A public address taken from RISEx's open competition leaderboard was used only to inspect response shapes; it is not recorded here. No credentials were used. Nothing is implemented. This extends [lighter-integration.md](lighter-integration.md), whose L0 generalization phase RISEx shares, and feeds three refinements back into it (see [Changes to the shared L0 design](#changes-to-the-shared-l0-design)).

RISEx is a fully on-chain central-limit-order-book perpetuals exchange on RISE Chain (chain ID 4153). Perpetuals-first still applies: every RISEx market is a perpetual, including its stock, commodity and index/ETF perpetuals.

## Verdict

RISEx is the **easiest venue so far**. Everything Vessel needs is public and keyed by an EVM address, including orders and fills, so it needs **no credential and no vault**. Authenticated access exists only for trading and for private WebSocket channels, and both require EIP-712 signatures from a registered session key. Vessel must never hold such a key, so it simply does not use those paths. That makes RISEx a closer fit to Hyperliquid (address, public reads) than to Lighter (account index, token for orders), and it exercises the venue descriptor with a third combination (`evm-address` source, `none` credential, numeric market IDs).

## What RISEx exposes

Base URL `https://api.rise.trade`, WebSocket `wss://ws.rise.trade/ws`. REST is `GET` with query parameters and JSON responses wrapped as `{"data": …, "request_id": …}` (the body contains a stray newline before `request_id`; parse it with a normal JSON parser). Rate limit **500 requests per 10 s per IP** (WebSocket: 10 requests/s). The docs mark the API as under heavy development, so response shapes may change.

**Timestamps are nanoseconds** unless noted, as decimal strings (e.g. `"1791209839000000000"`, which fits `long` but not a double). All `intervals` and `from`/`to` candle bounds are in nanoseconds too.

**Header caveat:** the API's firewall answered `403` to the default `Python-urllib` user agent while accepting curl, an empty one and a custom one. Vessel sets an explicit `User-Agent`.

### Public endpoints used

| Need | Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalogue | `GET /v1/markets` | Cached upstream for 5 min. 38 markets on October 5: 18 crypto, 11 stocks, 4 index/ETF, 4 commodities, 1 deprecated. Per market: `market_id` (string int), `config.name` (`BTC/USDC`), `config.step_price` (tick), `config.step_size` (lot), `config.min_order_size`, `config.max_leverage` (3–25), `config.maintenance_margin_factor` (4.5–37.5, unit unverified), `active`, `config.unlocked`, `category`, `mark_price`, `index_price`, `last_price`, `open_interest`, 24 h stats, `current_funding_rate`, `funding_interval` (always 3,600,000,000,000 ns = 1 h) |
| Account snapshot | `GET /v1/portfolio/details?account=0x…` | Decimal strings. Summary: `total_account_value` (equity), `usdc_balance`, `collateral_margin_balance`, `cross_margin_balance`, `free_collateral`, `total_unrealized_pnl`, `total_initial_margin`, `total_maintenance_margin`, `realized_pnl`, `unsettled_usdc`, `in_liquidation`, `risk_level`. Positions per market: `size`, `side`, `avg_entry_price`, `mark_price`, `leverage`, `unrealized_pnl`, `liquidation_price`, `margin_mode`, margin fields. Markets with no position appear with `size: "0"` and must be skipped. |
| Raw positions | `GET /v1/positions?account=…` | **18-decimal fixed-point integers** (`"size": "702475000000000000"` is 0.702475). Not used: portfolio details carries the same facts as decimals. |
| Fills | `GET /v1/trade-history?account=…&market_id=&start_time=&end_time=&page=&limit≤1000` | Page-numbered with `has_next_page`; time bounds in ns. Per fill: `id`, `order_id`, `market_id`, `side` (`BUY`/`SELL`), `price`, `size`, `fee` (USDC amount), `liquidity_indicator` (`MAKER`/`TAKER`), `time`, `blockchain_data.tx_hash`, `is_liquidation`, `realized_pnl`, `leverage`, `margin_mode`, `position_side`, `is_otc` |
| Orders | `GET /v1/orders?account=…&page=&limit≤1000` (history incl. open, filled, cancelled) and `GET /v1/orders/open?account=…` (resting, from on-chain state) | `id` (hex composite, equals the fill's `order_id`), `side`, `type` (`LIMIT`/`MARKET`), `time_in_force`, `status` (`ORDER_STATUS_OPEN`/`FILLED`/`CANCELLED`/…), `price`, `size`, `filled_size`, `avg_price`, `reduce_only`, `post_only`, `stop_type`, `stop_price`, `cancel_reason`, `created_at` (ns), `is_liquidation` |
| TP/SL orders | `GET /v1/orders/tpsl?account=…` | Stored off-chain by RISEx, executed on-chain when the stop price is met. Own status vocabulary (to verify). |
| Realized PnL events | `GET /v1/portfolio/realized-pnl?account=…` | Position-change events with entry/exit price, size, `pnl`, `funding`. Possible cross-check, not required. |
| Candles | `GET /v1/markets/id/{market_id}/trading-view-data?interval=<ns>&from=<ns>&to=<ns>` | See below. |

Everything above answered with **no authentication**. The OpenAPI files declare an empty `security` list for them.

### Candles: three hazards

1. **The parameters are `from`/`to`**, not `start_time`/`end_time`. The latter are silently ignored and the endpoint returns about the last hour.
2. **Native intervals are `1m 5m 15m 1h 4h 1d 1w`.** Any other value (`3m`, `30m`, `2h`, `8h`, `12h`, `3d`) silently falls back to **1m candles** (for `3d` that returned 42,529 rows), and `1M` is an error. Each row carries its `interval` label, so the adapter must reject a response whose label differs from the one requested.
3. **No row cap.** `5m` over 30 days returned 8,639 rows and `1h` over a year 4,496. The adapter must bound the window itself (as `CandleService` already caps Hyperliquid at 5,000 candles). History reaches back to the March 31, 2026 launch.

Rows have `time` (ns, bucket start), `open/high/low/close/volume` as decimal strings and **no trade count**.

### Streaming

`orderbook`, `trades`, `oracle` and `expected_funding_rate` are public; `orders`, `positions`, `fills`, `funding` and `account` need an EIP-712 authenticated session key. **There is no candle channel.** A live chart would be assembled from the public `trades` channel (price, size, per block) plus `oracle` (mark/index per block). Heartbeat: the server pings every 30 s and closes after 60 s without inbound traffic. Subscriptions are by **numeric `market_ids`**; subscribe requests are `{"method":"subscribe","params":{"channel","market_ids"}}`.

## Mapping to Vessel

### Identity and instruments

- **Account = EVM address** (the main wallet, 42 hex characters). The `evm-address` source type from the shared design applies unchanged. The same wallet can hold a Hyperliquid and a RISEx Vessel account because uniqueness is per owner, venue and source.
- **Contract = numeric `market_id`** (`VenueContractId`), with names like `BTC/USDC`. The canonical instrument is asset `BTC`, multiplier 1, quote `USDC` (key `BTC`). The map is built from `/v1/markets`.
- **Retired markets.** Market 13 is `DOGE/USDC [deprecated-1779958099]` (inactive) next to the live market 14 `DOGE/USDC`, and both reduce to `DOGE`. The one-to-one rule applies to **active** markets only. A retired market maps to the same key flagged `retired`, is never selectable, and its historical facts keep `VenueContractId = 13`. Order linking considers only the active market's orders. A venue-name suffix the map cannot classify excludes the market and is listed in the notice, never guessed.
- **Categories.** `category` (`crypto`, `stocks`, `commodity`, `index_etf`) is kept as display metadata on `VenueInstrument`. Hyperliquid's primary DEX is crypto only and Lighter's list is crypto-heavy, so equity perpetuals (`TSLA`, `NVDA`, `SPY`, `XAU`) are new to Vessel. They are perpetuals, so they are in scope, but their trading hours and oracle behaviour differ (to verify before offering liquidation estimates for them).

### Normalized execution facts

| Fact | RISEx source | Normalized |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Side | `side` `BUY`/`SELL` | `buy`/`sell` |
| Position effect | `position_side` is the side of the position the fill acts on. In 3,000 fills of one account: `side != position_side` in 1,671 (always with realized PnL beyond the fee: reducing or closing); `side == position_side` in 1,329, of which 1,097 had `realized_pnl == -fee` (opening or increasing) and **232 carried extra PnL** | `close` when different, `open` when equal and `realized_pnl == -fee`, otherwise `unknown`. The 232 are probably flips (the fill closes one position and opens the other, so `position_side` is the new side) or funding settled on trade; the open questions below decide it. Until verified they are `unknown`, never guessed as `open`. |
| Order ID | `order_id` = order `id` | direct link, no price matching needed |
| Fee | `fee`, USDC amount, 1 to 3 bps of notional | reported, `FeeBasis = reported` |
| Closed PnL | `realized_pnl` | **net of the fee**: every opening fill has `realized_pnl == -fee` exactly. Vessel's sizing computes closed PnL minus fees, so using this field as is would count the fee twice. See `PnlBasis` below. |
| Time | `time`, nanoseconds | UTC, millisecond precision kept, nanosecond string kept in raw facts |
| Liquidation | `is_liquidation` | preserved as venue flag |
| Order status | `ORDER_STATUS_OPEN`/`FILLED`/`CANCELLED`/… | `Open`/`Filled`/`Canceled`/… with the venue word kept |

Price rule: `config.step_price` (a tick) per market, e.g. 0.1 for BTC and 0.00001 for DOGE.

Margin: per-market `margin_mode` (cross `0` / isolated), leverage per position, `liquidation_price` reported by the venue. Equity, wallet and collateral stay distinct (`total_account_value` vs `usdc_balance` vs `free_collateral` vs `unsettled_usdc`) and are never summed, following `stablecoin-wallet.md`. The only supported collateral is USDC on RISE Chain, so there is no wallet read: the capital context shows equity and free collateral. The meaning of `unsettled_usdc` and `margin_health` needs verifying.

### What RISEx needs that Hyperliquid and Lighter did not

- A fill needs **`PnlBasis`** (`gross` for Hyperliquid, `net-of-fee` for RISEx) beside `FeeBasis`, and the sizing service must use it (task L0.5).
- A price tick (`PriceStep`) is the common form of a price rule (task L0.7).
- A stream protocol may have **no native candle channel** (task L0.2); chart refresh then uses REST.
- Candle intervals vary per venue, and an unsupported one must be rejected, not rounded (task L0.8).

## Changes to the shared L0 design

Applied to [lighter-integration.md](lighter-integration.md) in the same change:

1. **L0.2 stream protocol** declares capabilities (`candles`, `context`) so a venue without a candle channel is supported.
2. **L0.5 execution facts** gain `PnlBasis` and the sizing service reads it.
3. **L0.7 price rule** becomes a `PriceStep` tick (Lighter's `price_decimals` is `10^-d`; RISEx's `step_price` is direct); Hyperliquid keeps its five-significant-figure rule.
4. **L0.3 descriptor** gains `Category` support on instruments, and `Source` takes both `evm-address` and `account-index`.
5. **L0.6 instrument map** is keyed by the venue's own contract identifier (`market_id` for Lighter and RISEx, coin name for Hyperliquid) and handles retired markets.

## Tasks

RISEx follows L0 and needs nothing from L1 or L2. Because it needs no credential and no vault, the owner chose to build it **before Lighter**: see the revised sequence above, which folds the L0 dependencies into slices S1 to S3. Each task is one reviewable change that keeps `scripts/check.sh` green.

| ID | Task | Scope | Done when | Depends |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1.1 | **Module skeleton.** `Venues/Risex`: descriptor (`evm-address` source, no credential, intervals `1m 5m 15m 1h 4h 1d 1w`, `tick-size` price rule, quote `USDC`, trade URL template), typed `HttpClient` with `RemoveAllLoggers()`, explicit `User-Agent`, 500/10 s budget with a safety margin (≤ 200 per 10 s), nanosecond timestamp helpers (`string → DateTimeOffset`, rejecting values beyond now + 5 min as Hyperliquid does). | Infrastructure | Helpers and budget unit-tested with `TimeProvider`; module registered, status `planned`. | L0 |
| R1.2 | **Catalogue and instrument map.** `/v1/markets` → active, unlocked markets as `VenueInstrument` (canonical asset, `PriceStep`, lot step, max leverage, category), retired market handling, cached about 5 min. | Risex module | Fixture from a recorded response: BTC, `DOGE` active/retired pair, a stock and a commodity; unclassifiable name excluded and noted. | R1.1, L0.6 |
| R1.3 | **Snapshot.** `/v1/portfolio/details` → positions (size × side, entry, uPnL, leverage, margin, reported liquidation price), account value (`total_account_value`), free collateral, margin used; zero-size rows skipped; equity, balance and unsettled kept distinct. | Risex module | Fixtures: no positions, long, short, isolated, in liquidation. | R1.2 |
| R1.4 | **Fills.** `/v1/trade-history` paged (≤ 1000 per page, bound the first refresh at 2,000 fills with a history notice that older fills are not imported), `side`/`position_side` → side and effect (`unknown` for the unverified same-side-with-PnL case), `order_id`, fee as reported, `PnlBasis = net-of-fee`, liquidation flag, nanosecond times. | Risex module, Application (sizing uses `PnlBasis`) | Fixtures: maker/taker × buy/sell × open/close; sizing test shows the fee is not counted twice; flip handling per the open question. | R1.2, L0.5 |
| R1.5 | **Orders.** `/v1/orders` (paged) + `/v1/orders/open` + `/v1/orders/tpsl`; status mapping, `stop_type`/`stop_price` → trigger, reduce-only, ns → UTC; verifies the order ID equals the fill's `order_id`. `PlayExecutionService` then tracks RISEx accounts with no credential. | Risex module, Application | Matcher and lifecycle tests run on a RISEx fixture: Planned → Open → Closed. | R1.4, L0.5, L0.7 |
| R1.6 | **Candles and market context.** `trading-view-data` with `from`/`to`, native-interval check (reject a response whose `interval` label differs), bounded window (≤ 5,000 candles, else clamp and notice), no trade count; context from `/v1/markets` (mark, index, last, open interest, 24 h volume, `current_funding_rate` hourly). | Risex module | Fixtures incl. a fallback-label response that must be rejected; chart shows RISEx candles in a manual check. | R1.2, L0.8 |
| R1.7 | **Account creation and rollout.** RISEx added to the account dialog (public address, validated like Hyperliquid's), `/api/system` status → `read-only`; chart live updates stay manual refresh until a trades-channel protocol exists. | Application, API, frontend | Create/duplicate/invalid tests; browser smoke adds a RISEx account from fixtures. | R1.1–R1.6, L0.9 |
| R1.8 | **Verification and docs.** Check the open questions with the owner's own account; update `account-management-contract.md`, `chart-plan.md` (intervals), `core-workspace-state.md`, `play-lifecycle.md` (RISEx tracking). | docs | Questions answered or explicitly deferred. | R1.7 |

### Later (not planned)

- Live chart from the public `trades` and `oracle` WebSocket channels (needs candle aggregation inside a stream protocol).
- Private streams: not possible without a session key, so polling stays the model.
- Depth/orderbook features: `getorderbooklevels` exists but is outside current scope.

## Owner decisions (October 5, 2026)

1. **Categories:** include every RISEx perpetual (crypto, stocks, commodities, index/ETFs), each with a visible **category tag** in the instrument picker. Liquidation estimates for non-crypto markets stay labelled as estimates and are verified in R1.8.
2. **Live chart:** manual refresh first, for testing; automatic updates (candles assembled from the public `trades` channel) follow once R1 works.
3. **Sequence:** RISEx first, **generalizing and refactoring as it makes sense** rather than as a separate neutral L0 phase. See [Revised sequence](#revised-sequence-risex-first).

## Revised sequence (RISEx first)

Doing RISEx first changes the order of the shared L0 work in [lighter-integration.md](lighter-integration.md). Each slice is a PR that is neutral for Hyperliquid and keeps `scripts/check.sh` green. A task moves to Lighter's phase when RISEx does not need it, so nothing is generalized before a second venue needs it.

| Slice | Contents | Why now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S1** | Venue registry and descriptor, services resolve adapters by `account.VenueId`, `/api/system` capabilities, frontend checks capabilities (L0.3, L0.9) | A second adapter cannot be injected without it. |
| **S2** | Normalized execution facts: `buy`/`sell`, `PositionEffect`, `FeeBasis`, `PnlBasis`; sizing reads `PnlBasis` (L0.5) | RISEx `realized_pnl` is net of fees. |
| **S3** | Canonical instrument and venue contract ID (RISEx `BTC/USDC` and numeric `market_id`), `PriceStep` and `Category` on `VenueInstrument`, loosened market-data contracts and descriptor-driven intervals (L0.6 core, L0.7, L0.8) | RISEx names, ticks, intervals and categories. |
| **S4** | RISEx module (R1.1 to R1.7). The strict JSON and bounded-HTTP helpers are extracted from the Hyperliquid adapter at the start (L0.1), because this is their second user. | The venue itself. |
| Deferred to Lighter | Generic stream relay (L0.2), generic `SourceId` instead of `Address` (L0.4), the Hyperliquid `k…` data migration and drawing-key rewrite, request budget tuning | RISEx uses an address and manual refresh, so it needs none of them. |

R1.8 (verification with the owner's account and docs) follows S4. Automatic chart updates for RISEx are a later task after that.

## Open questions to verify with a real account (R1.8)

- What the 232 same-side fills with extra realized PnL are: flips (`position_side` would then be the new side) or funding settled on trade. Compare them with `/v1/portfolio/realized-pnl` events and the position size before and after.
- The `realized_pnl` of a closing fill: net of its own fee only, or also of funding? (Opening fills equal `-fee`; the rate and `funding` fields in `realized-pnl` events can be compared.)
- Meaning and units of `maintenance_margin_factor`, `unsettled_usdc` and `margin_health`.
- TP/SL order statuses and how a triggered TP/SL appears in `/v1/orders`.
- Whether `orders/open` and `orders` can disagree briefly after a fill (open orders come from on-chain state, history from an indexer).
- Isolated margin positions: the margin shown in the capital context and the liquidation estimate.
- Whether the firewall's user-agent filtering applies to datacenter IPs or only to default client strings.
- The `fee_bps` order field (values 150 and 300 seen) against the 1–3 bps actually charged per fill.
